### Overview

The purpose of this report is to analyze the service quality problem EASI faces. Specific objectives were to identify the causes of current service quality problems and offer recommendations for utilizing data assistance to improve service quality.
Problem was found in delivery timing, customer service and management system. The report recommends the adoption of data acquisition and analysis to improve the routing algorithm and updated rules for deliverers and stricter supervision systems. 
 
### Background of EASI
EASI is an online food ordering and delivery platform founded in 2015. The official website shows there are over 1.5 million app downloads and 30 thousand daily orders. The founder Jie (Jason) Shen, who saw the dramatic development in the food delivery industry in China and noticed the potential market in Australia, started his food ordering and delivery service in Melbourne in 2014 and expanded in crossing major cities in Australia (Cara Water).

#### The Industry EASI Operates In
From the Australian industry classifications - The Australian Bureau of Statistics, EASI belongs to Pick-up and Delivery Services Industry. This industry is benefited from the boosted amount of logistic demand brought by booming digital technology. The demand is increased sharply because consumers are accustomed to the maximized convenience and transparency of shopping/ ordering online through apps or websites.

#### EASI’s Business Model 

Lewis gives a simple definition of the business model – ‘All it really means was how you planned to make money’ (Ovans, Andrea). EASI’s business model is like Uber Eats, Menulog, Deliveroo and other food delivery platforms. EASI acts as a linking bridge between restaurants and customers that offers restaurants a new customer pool and a higher utilization level of kitchen facilities; it offers consumers convenience and greater choice. Therefore, EASI’s way to make money is to charge restaurants for commissions, and advertisement fees (if any) and charge customers for delivery fees.
 
### Service Quality Problem EASI Faces
As abovementioned, the Pick-up and Delivery Services Industry is booming due to the ramping demand. The companies in this industry, including EASI, are thriving by the widespread of digital technology, especially during the pandemic of COVID-19. However, for EASI, the downside of the increased demand is the deterioration of service quality. 

There are a few aspects of service quality problems found in EASI: 
1.	Delivery timing is the most critical part of customer satisfaction. (Carsten Hirschberg)
There are many negative reviews on social media and the EASI app saying the delivery timing delays significantly. Especially in peak time, the actual delivery time takes much longer than the estimated delivery time.

2.	Deliver incorrect type/ number of order and inappropriate behavior of deliverer
9News reported one of the EASI deliverers was inspected eating the customer’s food after he took the order from the restaurant and then fixing the orders properly so the customer would not know. Nevertheless, many negative reviews on EASI delivered wrong order/ number of orders are found on social media and EASI app.

3.	Management system
Some EASI users posted negative reviews on the EASI app but found their reviews were deleted by the admin. Furthermore, some users use social media to reveal that some of the prices on menus on the EASI app are different from the price on the restaurant menu although EASI announces the price is always the same.
 
### Data Assistance to Improve Service Quality 
Using data or big data as a tool to solve problems businesses face or to improve business in certain areas is a common trend all over the world. EASI can also use data to improve its service quality. Below is the data divided into 3 different types that EASI can gather and process to address the current problem.
Benard Marr provides a clear definition of 3 types of data:
1.	Structured data: data elements can be mapped into predefined fields. 
(Structured data EASI can use: customers' address details, demographic information, order frequency and preference of customers, star ratings by customers etc.)

2.	Unstructured data: data that cannot be fitted into a row and column database and does not have a data model.
(Unstructured data EASI can use: reviews including text review and photo review, social media content, customer service phone call recording etc.)

3.	Semi-structure data: data has some consistent elements but does not conform to a rigid structure as a relational database.
(Semi- structure data EASI can use: email queries, digital photo reviews etc.)

For each aspect of the service quality, there are proposals using data assistance to improve as follows:

1.	Delivery timing can be compressed by utilizing data assistance. The data that could be gathered are the customers' address details, demographic information, order frequency and preference of customers. 
These structured data can be processed and analyzed to improve the algorithm of the route calculation. EASI can also use these data to predict and plot the different demands in different areas, and at different times, therefore, EASI can allocate different numbers of deliverers to different locations based on data analysis so that the delivery timing will be shortened and the manpower efficiency will be optimized.

2.	Delivering incorrect type/ number of orders and inappropriate behavior of deliverer is relatively harder to be improved through data usage compared to delivery timing, and it is related to the management system aspect. Because EASI’s control over deliverers is relatively weak because EASI’s deliverers are subcontractors, not direct employees. The most effective way to increase the delivery quality/ customer service quality needs to be executed by the management team.   
The management team should be aware of the importance of reviews provided by customers. They should confront the problem of negative reviews and even collect more reviews from social media and new reports. By analyzing such unstructured information, a practical deliverer grading system could be established to assess the performance of each deliverer. And a bonus system can be set up with a high bonus for a high-grade deliverer and some punishment for a low-grade deliverer. 

### Conclusion
In conclusion, by gathering and processing useful data, EASI is able to improve customer service quality comprehensively by shortening the delivery time, improving the deliverer’s performance and developing a more customer-focused management structure.
